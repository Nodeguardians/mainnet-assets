# `neutron-1` Chain Details

The `neutron-1` chain will be launched as a consumer chain with Cosmos Hub network as provider chain.

* Params:
  * **Chain-ID**: `neutron-1`
  * **denom**: `untrn`
  * **minimum-gas-prices**: `0untrn`
  * **timeout_commit**: `1s`
  * **Spawn time**: `2023-05-08T11:00:00Z`
    * Even if a proposal passes, the CCV state will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.
* Binary:
  * **GitHub repo**: [neutron-org/neutron](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron.git)
  * **Release**: [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
  * **Reference binary**: [neutrond-linux-amd64](./neutrond-linux-amd64)
    * The `neutrond-linux-amd64` binary is only provided to verify the SHA256. It was built with Interchain Security release [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/releases/tag/v1.0.0). You can generate the binary following the build instructions in that repo.
  * **Binary sha256sum**: `82b608543f2989c7c631d555767800e48f54ede389d193913136b41e5c3293ab`
* Genesis:
  * **Genesis file with CCV state:** [neutron-1-genesis.json](neutron-1-genesis.json)
    * **SHA256 `4d897938a69a3809828e70f34c7400ec134817fe34ca4090dbe5991d72fa744c`
  * **Pre genesis file published with proposal _without CCV state_:** [neutron-1-pre-genesis-without-ccv.json](./neutron-1-pre-genesis-without-ccv.json), verify with `shasum -a 256 neutron-1-pre-genesis-without-ccv.json`
    * **SHA256 `4d897938a69a3809828e70f34c7400ec134817fe34ca4090dbe5991d72fa744c`
    * The `neutron-1-pre-genesis-without-ccv.json` file **cannot be used** to run the chain. Current pre genesis published in the proposal will not be used to generate final genesis, because of different configuration changes that was not available during proposal submission;
  * **Final genesis file _without CCV state_:** [neutron-1-pre-genesis-final-without-ccv.json](./neutron-1-pre-genesis-final-without-ccv.json), verify with `shasum -a 256 neutron-1-pre-genesis-final-without-ccv.json.json`
    * **SHA256 `4d897938a69a3809828e70f34c7400ec134817fe34ca4090dbe5991d72fa744c`
    * The `neutron-1-pre-genesis-final-without-ccv.json` will be used to generate genesis file but it cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state after the spawn time is reached;

Notice: the genesis file includes following slashing parameters:
* `signed_blocks_window` is `140000`
* `min_signed_per_window` is `5%`

> Since [**Prop 792**](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/792) was published, Neutron released a new version, v1.0.0, which is going to be used for the mainnet launch. The only difference between v1.0.0-rc1, which was used in the proposal, and v1.0.0 is the upgrade of Interchain Security to the latest release, v1.2.1:
>
> https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/compare/v1.0.0-rc1..v1.0.0
>
>**All validators are required to use v1.0.0 during the mainnet launch. The instructions on how to bulid v1.0.0 can be found in the [How to Join](#how-to-join) section.**

> If you want to build genesis by your own please take into account difference between the `ccvconsumer` section generated by version v9.0.3 of `gaiad` and the `ccvconsumer` section required for neutron to run. Please check and add `"soft_opt_out_threshold": "0.05"` to the `params` section if it absent.
