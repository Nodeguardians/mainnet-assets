# `neutron-1` Chain Details

The `neutron-1` chain will be launched as a consumer chain with Cosmos Hub network as provider chain.

* **Chain-ID**: `neutron-1`
* **denom**: `untrn`
* **minimum-gas-prices**: `0untrn`
* **timeout_commit**: `1s`
* **Spawn time**: `2023-05-08T11:00:00Z`
* **GitHub repo**: [neutron-org/neutron](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron.git)
* **Release**: [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
* **Genesis file with CCV state:** [neutron-1-genesis.json](neutron-1-genesis.json)

* **Reference binary**: [neutrond-linux-amd64](./neutrond-linux-amd64)
* **Binary sha256sum**: `c463557529511436c6d865de1a13fd071fac4727d422f7194ddd5f22360821bf`
* **Pre genesis file published with proposal _without CCV state_:** [neutron-1-pre-genesis-without-ccv.json](./neutron-1-pre-genesis-without-ccv.json), verify with `shasum -a 256 neutron-1-genesis-without-ccv.json`
* **SHA256 for Pre genesis file _without CCV state_**: `4d897938a69a3809828e70f34c7400ec134817fe34ca4090dbe5991d72fa744c`


* Genesis file hash
  * The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file (without CCV state) that the proposer has made available for review;
  * The `neutron-1-genesis-without-ccv.json` file cannot be used to run the chain. Current pre genesis published in the proposal will not be used to generate final genesis, because of different configuration changes that was not available during proposal submission;
  * New pre genesis will be published in Friday;
  * The genesis file includes following slashin parameters, `signed_blocks_window` has been set to `140000`, and `min_signed_per_window` has been set to `5%`;
* Binary hash
  * The `neutrond-linux-amd64` binary is only provided to verify the SHA256. It was built with Interchain Security release [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/neutron-org/neutron/releases/tag/v1.0.0). You can generate the binary following the build instructions in that repo or using one of the scripts provided here.
* Spawn time
  * Even if a proposal passes, the CCV state will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

Since [**Prop 792**](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/792) was published, Neutron released a new version, v1.0.0, which is going to be used for the mainnet launch. The only difference between v1.0.0-rc1, which was used in the proposal, and v1.0.0 is the upgrade of Interchain Security to the latest release, v1.2.1:

**All validators are required to use v1.0.0 during the mainnet launch. The instructions on how to bulid v1.0.0 can be found in the [How to Join] section. **

> If you want to build genesis by your own please take into account difference between the `ccvconsumer` section generated by version v9.0.3 of `gaiad` and the `ccvconsumer` section required for neutron to run. Please check and add `"soft_opt_out_threshold": "0.05"` to the `params` section if it absent.
